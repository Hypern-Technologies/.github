# Hypernâ„¢: Origins 

We are a group of just 2 students trying to create something amazing and unique while also considering what lies ahead of us. We started this so-called "company" as an initative to create an exploration website. We were so fascinated by the things that exists on the internet that we were obsessed to create something like that. We learned Jquery and how to work with apis and also Mastered HTML5 and CSS only to discover that Web Development is way beyond what we had learnt. Frameworks, libraries, site generators, etc. were introduced to us. So we made the decision to simply abandon the notion of building a website. We returned a few months later and made the decision to try again, but we failed. This went on for a VERY LONG time, and I suppose it's still going on today. So, we made the decision to do it now, and here we are. Instead of making a big leap towards front-end development and other things, we are attempting to start small now. However, given our studies, the work will be relatively meagre. But whether it's weeks or months, or even years, we will finish what we had started

I have no idea who's reading this but this is (or was) our story.
